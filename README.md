# python-observer-english-code
fresh code

#### code refactored from pt-br to en-us from the following repository created to complete a class assigment.```https://github.com/lucasbogo/python-observer```

#### Assigment: create two observers ```User``` and ```Supplier``` for the subject ```Stock```.

- the supplier adds, the user buys. Everythin is working perfectly.

# python-observer
Observer pattern for didatic project

The user that wants to receive a notification everytime the wanted product is in stock, will receive the mentioned notification trough the observer patter.
<br>
<br>
 
Therefore, in this pattern the **Subject** represents the entity in which observers are interested in. The **Observer** represents all the objects that will be notified when when the Subject's state changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Functionality TODO -> DONE!

- **TODO**: create a new class observer, namely, Supplier (Fornecedor in ptbr) and implement a notification message for every product the supposed supplier sends to the e-shop.
- **Returns**: message notificing the supplier whenever the product is sent to the e-shop's stock.
